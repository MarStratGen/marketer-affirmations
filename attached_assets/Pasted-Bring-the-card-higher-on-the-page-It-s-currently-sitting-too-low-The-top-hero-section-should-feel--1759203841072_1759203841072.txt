Bring the card higher on the page.
It‚Äôs currently sitting too low. The top hero section should feel tightly stacked with consistent rhythm.

Reduce vertical spacing between:

The main title (Marketer Affirmations)

The tagline (Unvarnished truths, elegantly phrased as affirmations.)

The area/filter controls

The affirmation card

The full stack should feel like a cohesive hero ‚Äî not a page with elements drifting apart.

Florals should interact more with the card visually.

Right now they just sit in the background with no relationship to the card.

Use a radial mask or vignette to let florals frame the card ‚Äî especially from corners or sides ‚Äî but fade out before reaching the text.

You can use mask-image: radial-gradient() or backdrop-filter: blur() for softening edges.

Give the card subtle depth.

Add a soft drop shadow (not grey, not heavy) to make it feel anchored, not floating in empty space.

Center the card in a tighter spotlight.

Apply a vignette or soft radial fade behind the card to help draw the eye in and reinforce the visual hierarchy.

üî§ TYPOGRAPHY + HIERARCHY

Main title and tagline

Treat Marketer Affirmations and the tagline as a designed unit (like a premium product label).

Use font size contrast, but minimal vertical spacing ‚Äî they should feel stacked, not separated.

Card micro-label (currently "For Motivational Use Only")

It‚Äôs too detached. Bring it closer to the quote.

Consider right-aligning it inside the card (like a stamp or tag) or nest it tightly above the quote in smaller caps.

Font size: 12‚Äì14px max, with tracking (letter-spacing) and faded color (#888 or rgba(0,0,0,0.5))

Button spacing and styling

Keep buttons (Share, Copy) tight to the quote ‚Äî they‚Äôre part of the interaction, not floating decorations.

Reduce bottom margin between quote and buttons.

Add gap: 12px or similar between buttons.

üå∏ AESTHETIC + TONE

The page should feel like:

‚ÄúA cross between a vintage etiquette guide, a luxury candle box, and a mid-level brand strategist‚Äôs inner monologue.‚Äù

Do not over-simplify.
The tone is refined but passive-aggressive, not clean and calm. Let the layout reflect tension between beauty and dysfunction.

‚úçÔ∏è TL;DR Summary

Pull all hero elements (title, tagline, filters, card) closer together vertically

Anchor the card visually with shadows + vignette

Let florals frame, not wallpaper

Tighten spacing inside the card

Bring tone and tension back to the layout
