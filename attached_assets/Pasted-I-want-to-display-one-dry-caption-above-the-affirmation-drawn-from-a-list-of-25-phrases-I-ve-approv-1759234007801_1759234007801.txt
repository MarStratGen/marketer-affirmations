I want to display one dry caption above the affirmation, drawn from a list of 25 phrases I've approved. It should randomly change every time the user clicks the “Affirm Me” button.

Please implement the following:

Create a JavaScript array with the 25 captions listed below.

Each time the “Affirm Me” button is clicked, randomly select one caption from the array and display it in a designated container above the quote (but inside the quote card, styled like a small subheading).

Do not animate the change — just update the text quietly.

Style it to match the rest of the site: small text, serif font, upper/lowercase (not all caps), colour should blend in with the card design — slightly muted, not bright white.

The selected caption should only change when the Affirm Me button is clicked — not when sharing, copying, or interacting elsewhere.

Use this array of phrases (verbatim):

[
  "Filed Under Sound Thinking",
  "Unquestionably Firm Logic",
  "The Sort of Thing One Hears Often",
  "Deemed Reasonable by the Usual Crowd",
  "Commonly Embraced by Upright Professionals",
  "Carried in Most Minds Without Incident",
  "Often Quoted, Rarely Understood",
  "Said with a Straight Tie and a Tight Deadline",
  "Heard in Good Offices Everywhere",
  "Passed Off as Wisdom Since the Brand Refresh of ’21",
  "Believed to Be Useful in Certain Contexts",
  "Held Up as an Example in the Quarterly Review",
  "Rarely Contested by the More Agreeable Departments",
  "Carried Forward from the Earlier Memo",
  "Generally Accepted as Directional",
  "Approved in Principle, Ignored in Practice",
  "Reinforced by a Notable Slide Transition",
  "Still Repeating from That Well-Received Panel Talk",
  "Not Yet Disproven by Available Evidence",
  "Backed Quietly by Several Middle Managers",
  "Endorsed During the Sandwich Break",
  "Found Scribbled Near a Flipchart Sketch",
  "Adhered to in Spirit, if Not in Execution",
  "Previously Highlighted in a Circulated PDF",
  "Kept Alive Through Habit and Hope"
]


Let me know if anything in the HTML needs to be changed to support this.
