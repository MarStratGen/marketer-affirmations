Open the files

In the left sidebar, open your main HTML file (usually index.html).

Also open your main stylesheet (usually styles.css). Keep both tabs open.

Find the button

In the HTML, scroll to the hero controls where the “Inspire me” button sits.

Click the button text and rename it to “Affirm me.”

Give that button a distinct class name that clearly says it is the primary action. If it already has one, keep it. If not, add one (for example, “affirm button” in your head — you’ll style that name in the CSS next).

Place it correctly

Ensure the button sits to the right of the “Marketing area” pill with a small gap.

The vertical alignment should be centered with the pill.

Keep it on a single line with the pill on desktop. It can wrap under on mobile.

Typeface & weight

Use the same serif family you use for headings (not the quote size, just the family).

Weight should be medium — visually a touch heavier than the area pill but not bold.

Shape & size

Make it a pill. Fully rounded corners.

Height: roughly the same as the area pill, just a little taller so it reads as the primary action.

Horizontal padding: slightly wider than the area pill so the word “Affirm me” has breathing room.

Colour and finish

Background: a muted plum to deep violet gradient that matches your florals. Think rich, not neon. If you’re picking by eye, lean closer to blackberry than magenta.

Text: warm off‑white, not stark white, so it blends with your card tone.

Add a soft shadow so it lifts off the floral background. Keep it subtle.

Hover and active

On hover: keep the same colours but make it feel 2 to 3 percent brighter and let it rise a pixel.

On active (mouse down): remove the rise so it “presses” back to normal.

Focus state (keyboard users)

Add a visible ring when the button is focused. Use a soft gold outer ring with a thin light inner ring so it is visible on top of dark florals.

Disabled state (optional)

If you disable the button after the first click, reduce opacity a bit, remove hover lift, and keep the cursor default.

Reduce motion preference

If the system prefers reduced motion, remove the little hover lift and any animated transitions. Keep the colour changes instantaneous.

Match the pill next to it

The “Marketing area: General” pill should feel related but quieter:

Keep it flatter (not a gradient)

Slightly thinner padding

Hairline border with low contrast

Text in soft near‑white, not bright white

Spacing

Maintain a small gap between the area pill and the button. If it looks cramped, increase only the horizontal gap, not the vertical spacing of the whole hero stack.

Mobile check

On narrow screens, allow the controls to wrap: area pill on the first line, button on the next line centered, with a small vertical gap.

Ensure the button still looks tappable — do not shrink the height on mobile.

Visual QA pass

With the page zoomed out slightly:

The button should read as the primary action without shouting.

It should echo the florals (plum/berry tones) and echo the card (warm off‑white text and soft gold focus).

Nothing should glow. Nothing should pulse. No glassy shine.

If it still feels off

Darken the gradient a touch (closer to blackberry).

Soften the shadow if it looks “app-y”.

Increase letter‑spacing slightly if the wordmark feels cramped.

Nudge the pill and button one or two pixels apart if they feel stuck together.
