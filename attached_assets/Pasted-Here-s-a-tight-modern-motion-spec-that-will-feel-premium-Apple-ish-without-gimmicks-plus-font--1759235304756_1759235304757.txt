Here’s a tight, modern motion spec that will feel premium (Apple‑ish) without gimmicks, plus font + dropdown notes. Use these values in Replit.

Outline button (“Affirm Me”)
Hover (micro‑elevation; no glow)

Border: white opacity .55 → .95

Fill: add a faint translucent wash 0% → 6–8% white (keeps it legible on busy florals)

Blur: backdrop blur +2–3px (only on hover)

Lift: translateY(-1px)

Timing: 140ms cubic-bezier(.2,.8,.2,1)

Optional polish: a subtle top highlight sweep across the border (900ms linear). If you try it and it reads “gaming UI,” drop it.

Active/press (fast, tactile)

Scale: 0.985 (snap)

Lift: return to baseline (translateY(0))

Border: ease back to ~.80 white

Timing: 90ms cubic-bezier(.3,.7,.4,1)

Focus (keyboard)

Rings: inner 1px white + outer 3–4px soft gold (#CBA86266)

No movement change on focus; keep motion for hover/press only.

Reduce motion

Respect prefers-reduced-motion: keep only color/border transitions (no lift/scale/blur).

Dropdown (outline trigger + matte menu)
Trigger (closed state)

Same outline recipe as the button, but 2–3px shorter and no fill by default.

Include a chevron (▾).

Trigger hover

Border: .55 → .90 white

Fill: 0% → 4–6% white (just enough to read)

Lift: translateY(-1px) (same 140ms easing)

Open

Chevron: rotate 0 → 180° in 120ms ease.

Menu panel: matte frosted glass (not glossy)

Opacity 0 → 1, translateY(6px → 0), 120ms ease‑out

Backdrop blur ~10px, border 1px (rgba(255,255,255,.14))

Row hover: +6% white wash; selected row gets a small dot or check at left.

Font (for buttons + dropdown only)

Use a UI sans — clean, neutral, high x‑height.

Recommended: system-ui, -apple-system, Segoe UI, Roboto, Inter, "Helvetica Neue", Arial, sans-serif

Weight: 600

Size: ~0.95rem (hero) / 0.92rem (inside card)

Letter‑spacing: 0.15–0.2px

Keep the rest of the site’s serif for headings/quotes; UI controls should be sans.

Quick DO / DON’T

Do

Keep outlines crisp; let “premium” come from micro‑lift + subtle fill + blur.

Ensure the control bar behind is transparent (no black slab), so blur samples the florals.

Don’t

No glow halos, no drop‑shadow pulses, no long bouncy animations.

Don’t put glass elements inside a parent with opacity or filter; it kills the blur.
