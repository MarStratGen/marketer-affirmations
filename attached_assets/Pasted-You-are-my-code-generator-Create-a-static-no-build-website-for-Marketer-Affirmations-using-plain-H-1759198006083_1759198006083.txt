You are my code generator. Create a static, no‑build website for Marketer Affirmations using plain HTML/CSS/JS. Do not use frameworks. Do not scaffold a Node server. Generate all files with full contents and make it look and feel like an Awwwards winner: refined, performant, and accessible.

Project Summary

Satirical affirmation generator for marketers. Visual direction: maximalist florals (BURGUNDY GARDEN vibe), elegant typography (Playfair Display or Cormorant for headings + Inter for UI/body fallback), soft glass surfaces, tasteful grain, and premium micro‑interactions. The page shows a single affirmation card with theme options, area filter, and actions to share/copy/download a 1080×1080 PNG with the floral look baked in.

Files to Create (exact names)

index.html

styles.css

app.js

data/affirmations.json ← seed with 70 affirmations across these single‑select areas: general, social, brand, performance, seo, email, content, product, events, growth (no “analytics”)

If you cannot access real images, programmatically generate placeholder assets on first run (burgundy‑gold gradients + simple floral‑like pattern) and write them to these exact filenames so paths never break.

Hard Requirements

One page with a hero, controls row, and a central Affirmation Card. Card must never be visually obscured by florals. Use masking to keep the center clear.

Three themes with a theme switcher:

Ornate: corner florals behind the card, light gold tint, grain. Center hollowed with a radial mask so text stays clean.

Ribbon: paper tape bar across the top, stamp mark floating above the card corner, gentle paper texture.

Glass: frosted glass card over a floral background on the stage, soft vignette and shadow for depth.

Area dropdown (single select) filtered against tags in JSON. Areas listed above.

Actions: New, Copy caption, Download PNG (1080×1080), Share (Web Share API with image on supported devices; otherwise copy caption).

Caption format (AU English, no em dash):

{quote}
from Marketer Affirmations
marketeraffirmations.com/a/{id}


Per‑affirmation deep link support in the front end only: read /a/:id and preselect that item if present. If not found, show a tasteful not‑found message with a button to get a new one.

PNG export: Canvas render of the current design at 1080×1080 with background, theme overlays, wrapped and auto‑fitted quote, and a footer “marketeraffirmations.com” at bottom‑right. No watermark other than the footer.

No backend for this visual test. Stub functions for future logging so nothing breaks.

A11y: keyboard focus rings, aria‑labels on interactive elements, reduced motion respected.

Visual + Motion Spec

Typography

Headline and quotes: Playfair Display or Cormorant Garamond. Provide optional Google Fonts <link> commented out and ship with system‑font fallbacks. Body/UI: Inter then system UI stack.

Type rhythm: quote line‑height ~1.16, letter‑spacing slight positive. Prevent widows for single last words by reflowing line breaks.

Colour

Primary accents: burgundy #5a1025, gold #b98b2e, ink #151517, paper #ffffff.

Background: soft radial white‑to‑eggshell vignette.

Card

Max width ~920px. Radius ~22px. Shadow a layered soft stack; avoid grey blobs.

Brand chip micro‑label at the top‑left inside the card (small caps, tracking).

Florals and Overlays

Ornate: florals-corners.png sits behind the card in ::before. Apply a center hollow mask: radial mask from card center, transparent in the center, opaque at edges, so florals never touch text. Gold tint overlay in ::after at very low opacity.

Ribbon: tape.png positioned top center over the card via ::after with a tiny shadow. stamp-ma.png floats as a positioned element with drop shadow; scale slightly on hover.

Glass: stage background uses bg-main.jpg with vignette and grain. Card is semi‑transparent with backdrop‑filter blur and a hairline border.

Micro‑interactions

Theme switch: cross‑fade florals/overlays with opacity transitions. No layout jumps.

Buttons: 2–3px lift on hover, springy but subtle. On tap, quick depress then release.

“New” button animates quote change with a short fade and 2px upward motion controlled by prefers-reduced-motion.

Performance

Use GPU‑friendly properties. Avoid heavy box‑shadows on large layers. Preload hero images. Use will-change: opacity, transform sparingly.

Lazy‑decode images and reuse single Image instances for canvas.

Accessibility

All interactive controls reachable by keyboard. Visible focus outlines with offset.

Reduced motion: if prefers-reduced-motion is set, disable parallax and dampen all transitions.

Minimum contrast for text on glass and over imagery.

App Behavior Details

On load, fetch data/affirmations.json.

If URL path matches /a/:id, load that specific affirmation. Otherwise pick a random one in the selected area or default to general.

Avoid immediate repeats. Keep a tiny history buffer.

URL query should reflect ?theme=X&area=Y so testers can share a state.

Actions:

Copy: puts the caption format into clipboard.

Share: 1) try Web Share with PNG file + caption; 2) if unsupported, copy caption and show a toast.

Download: triggers a client download named affirmation-{id}.png.

Text fitting on canvas:

Safe box centered in the card area. Binary search font size between 26px and 72px with word‑wrap. If it still overflows at min size, shrink line‑height by a small amount and try again. Keep line count readable.

Footer text rendered last in bottom‑right, never cropped.

Structure to Implement

index.html

Proper meta and OG tags using public/graphics/bg-main.jpg.

Hero heading “Marketer Affirmations” with subline “Beautiful on the outside. Dead inside.”

Controls row: theme select (Ornate / Ribbon / Glass), area dropdown, New button.

Stage wrapper that can carry the Glass theme’s floral background.

Card containing: brand chip, quote, actions row (Share, Download, Copy, New), floating stamp element (visible for Ribbon only).

Hidden export <canvas id="exportCanvas" width="1080" height="1080">.

Load app.js at end of body.

styles.css

Token section for colours, radius, shadows, font stacks, and sizes.

Base reset and layout container.

Card styles with ::before/::after overlays and mask so florals do not overlap text.

Theme selectors via [data-theme="Ornate" | "Ribbon" | "Glass"].

Button and select styles: pill buttons, clean borders, strong focus rings.

Motion keyframes with reduced‑motion media queries.

app.js

State: data, pool, current, theme, area, cached assets.

Load JSON and images. If assets missing, generate placeholder images then continue.

Read URL for theme and area; react to theme/area changes by re‑rendering and updating URL.

Quote update with small, interruptible fade transition.

Canvas export function that renders background, vignette, grain, optional overlays, wrapped text, and footer in that order.

Share and copy helpers.

Stub postLog() that no‑ops in this visual test.

Seed Data Spec for data/affirmations.json

Array of 70 objects with fields:

id: e.g. "A041"

tags: array with one area string from the allowed set

text: dry, dark, satirical line, safe for sharing

Include at least 6 per area, and the rest under general. Example records:

{"id":"A001","tags":["general"],"text":"If it moves, I will funnel it."}

{"id":"A014","tags":["brand"],"text":"Our brand voice is “please approve this by EOD”. "}

{"id":"A028","tags":["performance"],"text":"Today I accept that CPA is mostly a feeling."}

{"id":"A033","tags":["social"],"text":"If it worked once on TikTok, it is now a strategy."}

{"id":"A052","tags":["growth"],"text":"Scale now, apologise in the retro we never book."}

Quality Bar and Checks (must pass before you finish)

Card text is never overlapped by florals in any theme. Confirm by resizing browser to mobile and desktop widths.

Theme switch fades elements smoothly without layout jumps. Reduced motion disables the fades.

PNG export includes the current visual theme faithfully. No blurry text, no clipped shadows, footer visible.

Share fallback copies caption and shows a non‑blocking toast.

All buttons reachable and usable by keyboard. Focus outline clearly visible on dark or light backgrounds.

Lighthouse Performance ≥ 90 and Accessibility ≥ 95 on desktop in preview mode. If needed, reduce heavy effects or image sizes.

Deliverables

Create the file structure above with full, working code.

Seed 70 affirmations as specified.

Implement the three themes and make them look polished in line with the visual spec.

Implement text fitting and export pipeline for 1080×1080 PNGs.
