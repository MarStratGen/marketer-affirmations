How to make a slick glass button (no code, exact settings)

Typography

Text: Affirm Me (title case)

Font: your system sans, weight 600

Letter‑spacing: a tiny bump so it breathes

Base look

Shape: full pill, a touch taller and wider than the dropdown pill so it reads as primary

Fill: transparent with a very subtle peach tint over it
Think “clear glass with a whisper of burnt apricot,” not opaque peach

Frosted glass

Backdrop blur: 6–8 px

Background opacity: 8–12% total. If the florals still shout through, nudge to 15%

Add a 1 px border in semi‑opaque off‑white so the edge stays crisp over busy petals

Specular highlight (the slick bit)

Add a soft top highlight that fades down by about 35–40% of the button height

Keep it very low opacity so it suggests curvature without going glossy

Color accents so it belongs to Theme A

Edge accent: a thin inner stroke in soft gold to echo your underline color

Text color: near‑white, not grey

Optional: a very light peach tint in the glass (2–4%) so it harmonises with the flower and your peach CTA experiments

Shadow

Short, soft shadow so it lifts off the floral noise

If it looks “app‑y,” reduce opacity, not blur

States

Hover: +3% brightness, rise 1 px

Active: drop back to baseline, same brightness as default

Focus: visible ring that matches your system

thin inner light ring

soft gold outer ring
This keeps it accessible on dark florals

Control bar behind it

Remove the black translucent slab behind the controls

If you must have a base, use a very faint clear glass strip with less blur than the button so the button still feels “premium”

Spacing

Keep 10–12 px gap between the dropdown and the button

Align their vertical centers

On mobile, let the button wrap under and stay tap‑friendly (do not shrink height)

When glass looks bad

If the background is too busy right behind the button, the glass will go muddy

Fix by raising the backdrop blur one step or nudging the controls to a calmer patch of the hero

Is “glass” still current?

Yes, when it is subtle and functional. The current look is:

very low opacity

restrained blur

crisp 1 px borders

tiny specular highlight

no neon gradients, no heavy glow

Follow the numbers above and the button will look slick as hell without feeling like a 2021 UI kit.
